# E-Commerce

## What is this?
This project is for learning Vue.js as a frontend framework and connect it to an express server. I'll be using MongoDB for storing my data
and also see if I can connect some kind of payment system and host this as afunctional site in the end. This is going to be an e-commerce site built from scratch inspired by Amazon design.
